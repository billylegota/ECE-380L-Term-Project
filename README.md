**Abstract**:
We investigate the application of meta-learning algorithms, specifically Model Agnostic Meta 
Learning (MAML) and Reptile, to an existing deep-learning based Wi-Fi channel estimation and
tracking system, DeepWiPHY. The meta-learning algorithms were compared against conventional 
methods such as random initialization, cross-evaluation, and retraining on multiple severities 
of multipath. Comparisons were made fairly with respect to the complexity of the adaptation of 
the model necessary for a new environment. Results indicate that the meta-learning algorithms 
tested do not provide any benefits over (and in fact underperform relative to) conventional 
retraining from the most severe multipath channel model. This result is promising as it 
indicates that the complexity both in implementation and computational resources of 
meta-learning can be avoided without any degradation of performance.
